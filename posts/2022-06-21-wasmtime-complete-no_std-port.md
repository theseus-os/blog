## Bringing `wasmtime` to `no_std`*

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ `wasmtime` now builds and runs on Theseus! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This is the first port of `wasmtime` to a `no_std`* environment, to the best of our knowledge. 
The initial barebones version of `wasmtime` was [completed and successfully run on Theseus on May 17th, 2022](https://github.com/kevinaboos/Theseus/commit/39a647581fdb7f259559400b6222613e3f914916).

This milestone marks the culmination of a very long journey, as evidenced by our previous several posts on this topic 
and the fact that our initial port started with a version of `wasmtime` from mid-October 2021. Yeesh!

* This post: Porting the top-level `wasmtime` crate and tying everything together

In this post, we aim to
1. Provide a high-level description of `wasmtime` and its multi-crate architecture,
2. Enumerate the changes needed to build `wasmtime` on `no_std`*, and
3. Itemize the dependencies/functionality that `wasmtime` requires from the underlying platform.

While we don't intend this to be a porting tutorial, we do hope it makes it easier to port and run `wasmtime` on other platforms in the future.

"C'mon, just skip to the <s>recipe</s> code already!"

No problem, [here is the full changeset to `wasmtime`](https://github.com/theseus-os/wasmtime/compare/35cdd53989b5eaa01691aac915d60cf609776ab6..c05b37c41b363008b9ff84b3493ea6d4f067cf88). 
Note that this doesn't include the many changes and extensions we made to Theseus to support this; those are described in the rest of the article. 


## 1. Summary of `wasmtime`'s key parts

The diagram below shows the major components of `wasmtime`[^1] and their dependencies, with a focus on those that *did not already support `no_std`* when our work began or required other forms of modification.
This intentionally excludes ubiquitous dependencies like error handling, heap allocation, and logging to keep the graph legible (...ish).

[^1]: For simplicity, we depict `wasmparser` as part of the set of `wasmtime` crates, even though it is actually part of the separate `wasm-tools` project.

We took a bottom-up approach to iteratively port lower-level dependencies until they compiled on `no_std` on Theseus, and then moved on to the next highest layer in the dependency stack. 
The lowest-level crates, `wasmparser`, `wasmtime-types`, and `wasmtime-environ` were relatively simple to port to `no_std`.

By far, the most complex crate to port is `wasmtime-runtime`, which not only has myriad dependencies that each needed porting, but also plenty of platform-specific code that is necessarily unsafe and quite intricate. 
We have already described our efforts to port `wasmtime-runtime` to Theseus in [two previous posts starting here](../../../2022/02/03/wasmtime-progress-update.html).


TODO: below

After `wasmtime-runtime` TODO, describe how the bulk of the work was done when porting `wasmtime-runtime` to Theseus, so once that's done the rest of the higher-level `wasmtime` components aren't terribly difficult to complete.

The real fun begins once you can finally compile all `wasmtime` crates on your platform and then attempt to run it


## 2. Changes made to `wasmtime` components

### Significant logic or structural changes

TODO start


### Minor changes 

TODO finish

* Error handling, particularly usage of `anyhow`
  * Primarily mapping the error type via `.map_err(anyhow::Error::msg)`.
* Substituted `no_std` versions of specific crates
  * `std::io` â†’ `core2::io`
  * `thiserror` â†’ `thiserror_core2`
* Required some minor changes to how `wasmtime` uses bincode, in accordance with [`bincode`'s migration guide](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode/blob/trunk/docs/migration_guide.md) to the newest version that supports `no_std`



### Trivial yet **tedious** changes for `no_std` compatibility
Many changes are trivial and thus glossed over in this post, such as changing import statements from `std::xyz` to `core::xyz` or `alloc::xyz` and modifying or patching dependency chains to disable `default-features`.
However, I don't want to understate the pure tedium of such changes because they require a lot of effort for no actual difference in functionality.
Many of the code diffs look like the collage of boring tedium below:
```patch
- use std::borrow::Borrow;
- use std::marker::PhantomData;
- use std::mem;
+ use core::borrow::Borrow;
+ use core::marker::PhantomData;
+ use core::mem;
```

```patch
[dependencies]
- anyhow = "1.0"
+ anyhow = { version = "1.0", default-features = false }
  cranelift-entity = { path = "../../cranelift/entity", version = "0.77.0" }
- wasmtime-types = { path = "../types", version = "0.30.0" }
+ wasmtime-types = { path = "../types", default-features = false, version = "0.30.0" }
- wasmparser = "0.81"
+ wasmparser = { version = "0.81", default-features = false }
  indexmap = { version = "1.0.2", features = ["serde-1"] }
- thiserror = "1.0.4"
+ thiserror = { version = "1.0.4", optional = true }
- serde = { version = "1.0.94", features = ["derive"] }
+ serde = { version = "1.0.94", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
  object = { version = "0.27", default-features = false, features = ['read_core', 'write_core', 'elf'] }
+ hashbrown = { version = "0.11.2", features = ["ahash"], default-features = false }
  ...

+ [patch.crates-io]
+ wasmparser = { path = "./path/to/ported/wasmparser/crate" }
+ object = { path = "./path/to/ported/object/crate" }
```

... and the procedure to patch dependencies that have been ported to `no_std` is even more tedious, shown below:
![porting_dependencies_to_no_std](/images/2022-posts/porting_deps_to_no_std.svg)


It would be a ***fantastic*** quality-of-life improvement if `std`'s re-exports of items from `core` and `alloc` could be transparently converted to their `no_std` equivalents, but that's a topic for another day.
In fact I've already suggested this in a presentation to select Rust team members entitled ["How Theseus uses Rust, plus Rust challenges", slides 47-51](https://www.theseus-os.com/Theseus/book/misc/papers_presentations.html#selected-presentations-and-slide-decks).



## 3. Functionality needed to fulfill wasmtime's dependencies
* Heap allocation for `alloc` types
  * Sorry, you ain't gonna run `wasmtime` without a heap!
* Stack unwinding for proper panic handling and ensuring drop handlers run
  * `wasmtime-runtime` requires both `catch_unwind` and `resume_unwind`
  * Also need to support registration of external unwind info that comes from WASM modules that were JIT-compiled into native code. This must allow Theseus's (or your platform's) unwinding routine to use it.
* `backtrace` for capturing a stack trace
  * Plus optional symbolication of addresses, i.e., `addr2line` functionality
* memory management: allocating memory regions, creating memory mappings, etc.
  * Uses crates like `libc`, `region`, `rsix` for Unixes
  * We had to slightly modify `wasmtime-runtime`'s structs for memory-mapped WASM modules and files to include an owned Theseus `MappedPages` instance
* Mutual Exclusion
  * We do use THeseus's own sleeping `Mutex` type, but this is also easily provided by crates like `spin`
* signal handling for traps
  * On Theseus, this means handling CPU exceptions
* `object` for object file editing
  * We contributed a PR to `object` that allowed reading _and_ writing of object files in a `no_std` environment
* `bincode` for (de)serialization
  * Just had to upgrade to newer major version that already supported `no_std`
  * Required some minor changes to how `wasmtime` uses bincode, in accordance with [`bincode`'s migration guide](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode/blob/trunk/docs/migration_guide.md)
* Basic reading of a file
  * Only needed when reading a AOT pre-compiled WASM module from a file for purposes of deserialization
* Tasks or threads
  * Fully preemptive is essentially required, as cooperative multitasking would require a significant rework of `wasmtime`
  * Async/await executors would also be needed if you chose to support that feature of `wasmtime`
* Thread-Local Storage (TLS)
  * See previous post
* `Path`s
* `psm` for portable stack manipulation
  * Only used to obtain the current value of the stack pointer register
* Basic I/O traits
  * Mostly just the basic ones from `std::io`, which are usable in `core` through a variety of `no_std` crates like `core2` (previously `bare_io`), `core_io`, etc.
* `more_asserts` for easy assertions
  * We contributed a PR to make this `no_std`
* Basic error handling via `anyhow` and `thiserror`
  * `anyhow` already supports `no_std`, but has a different API due to its reliance on `std::error::Error`. We had to painstakingly modify every call to `anyhow` with an additional `.map_err(anyhow::Error::msg)` statement.
  * `thiserror` cannot support `no_std` yet, but there are `no_std`-compatible drop-in alternatives like `thiserror_core2` which derive `core2::error::Error` instead
  * Once the `std::error::Error` trait is moved into `core`, all of these pain points will be permanently healed!
* `crc32fast`, a dependency of the `object` crate
  * We contributed a PR to make this compile properly for custom targets
* A source of randomness
  * Easiest course of action is to use `rand`'s `SmallRng` in `no_std`
* Basic I/O, e.g., for printing to the screen, console, or a log

### Picking up where we left off
In our [prior post](2022/04/12/wasmtime-progress-update-2.html), we had completed all crates from the bottom up to and including `wasmtime-runtime`.
The remaining components that we completed from mid-April through mid-May were `wasmtime-jit` and the top-level `wasmtime` crate itself.
