## Bringing `wasmtime` to `no_std`*

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ `wasmtime` now builds and runs on Theseus! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This is the first port of `wasmtime` to a `no_std`* environment, to the best of our knowledge. 
The initial barebones version of `wasmtime` was [completed and successfully run on Theseus on May 17th, 2022](https://github.com/kevinaboos/Theseus/commit/39a647581fdb7f259559400b6222613e3f914916).

This milestone marks the culmination of a very long journey, as evidenced by our previous several posts on this topic 
and the fact that our initial port started with a version of `wasmtime` from mid-October 2021. Yeesh!

In this post, we aim to
1. Provide a high-level description of `wasmtime` and its multi-crate architecture,
2. Enumerate the changes needed to build `wasmtime` on `no_std`*, and
3. Itemize the dependencies/functionality that `wasmtime` requires from the underlying platform.

While we don't intend this to be a porting tutorial, we do hope it makes it easier to port and run `wasmtime` on other platforms in the future.

"C'mon, just let me skip to the <s>recipe</s> code already!"

No problem, [here is the full changeset to `wasmtime`](https://github.com/theseus-os/wasmtime/compare/35cdd53989b5eaa01691aac915d60cf609776ab6..c05b37c41b363008b9ff84b3493ea6d4f067cf88). Note that this doesn't include the many changes and extensions we made to Theseus to support this; those are described in the rest of the article. 


## Summary of `wasmtime`'s key parts

TODO: insert diagram of wasmtime dependencies 

NOTE: this diagram includes only the components of `wasmtime` and its dependencies that *do not already support `no_std`*. 

## A Bottom-up Approach to Porting

We take a bottom-up approach to iteratively port lower-level dependencies
