## Theseus's First Full Year 

Although 2021 not the first year of Theseus development, it _was_ the first whole year in which:
1. Theseus was fully open-sourced and publically known to the community.
2. Theseus received interest from academic and industry collaborators.
3. Theseus received funding for open-source development from industry (yay!).
4. Our focus shifted from prototyping research concepts to feature completeness, stabilization, and legacy compatibility.


The rest of this blog entry is a work in progress. Check back soon!


<!-- ### Adding more features -->



<!-- ### Legacy compatibility -->



### Thanks to 2021's Contributors!

Beyond our usual contributors, we had several newcomers from both Yale University and the open-source community at large who generously devoted their time to make some excellent improvements to Theseus. 
Our sincere thanks to:
 * Futurewei Technologies, especially [Sid Askary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sid-askary-21a962) and [Yong He](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yong-he-1334902), for generously offering technical advice and funding for Theseus development.
 * [@apogeeoak](https://github.com/apogeeoak), who improved documentation quality and implemented GitHub workflows to autogenerate docs.
 * [Vikram Mullick](https://github.com/vikrammullick), who began and nearly finished support for running WASM+WASI binaries atop Theseus.
 * [Jacob Earle](https://github.com/jacob-earle), who began support for logging output on ARM microcontrollers and a pseudo-real time scheduling algorithm for Theseus.
 * [Josh Triplett](https://github.com/joshtriplett), who served as a valuable font of advice and sounding board for some of my wild Theseus ideas.
 * [Philipp Oppermann](https://github.com/phil-opp), whose project [Blog OS](https://os.phil-opp.com/) helped kickstart Theseus development a few years ago.
