<p>A <a href="2021-12-31-November-December-Update-WASM.md">previous post from late 2021</a> chronicled our ongoing journey to port <code>wasmtime</code> to Theseus.
While our bottom-up approach got off to a strong start, we quickly encountered our first major challenge when examining the <code>wasmtime-runtime</code> crate, as it contains many dependencies on platform-specific and legacy system interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unix-like memory mapping and protection</li>
<li>Signal/trap handling</li>
<li>Thread-local storage</li>
<li>Stack introspection and backtracing</li>
<li>File and I/O abstractions</li>
<li>Exception (panic) handling and unwinding resumption</li>
</ul>
<p>This post describes our progress over a few weeks of working to add these features to Theseus in order to support <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>'s many complex dependencies.</p>
<h3><a href="#porting--reorganizing-third-party-libraries" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="porting--reorganizing-third-party-libraries"></a>Porting &amp; reorganizing third-party libraries</h3>
<p>We first re-organized Theseus's repository to include two folders for third-party crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>libs/</code>: contains standalone crates that don't depend on Theseus, but can be used by Theseus and others.</li>
<li><code>ports/</code>: contains crates that have been ported to depend directly on Theseus-specific crates, e.g., those in <code>kernel/</code> and are thus not standalone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main features ported over the past couple of months (early winter 2021-2022) are shown in the table below:</p>

<h4><a href="#porting-libc-to-theseus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="porting-libc-to-theseus"></a>Porting <code>libc</code> to Theseus</h4>
<p>Support for a minimal subset of <code>libc</code> functionality has been an ongoing but low-priority effort, mostly for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Running C code directly on Theseus is inherently unsafe, as C is not a safe language and can thus violate Theseus's language safety-based isolation and resource usage guarantees.</li>
<li>No crates that THeseus depends on have needed an underlying <code>libc</code>, thus Theseus as a platform did not need to offer one... until now.</li>
</ol>
<p>Theseus's libc implementation is called <code>tlibc</code>. which is described in <a href="https://www.theseus-os.com/Theseus/book/c/programs.html">this book chapter</a>.
So far it has been loosely based on the Redox project's <code>relibc</code>.</p>
<p>Our efforts of late were focused on supporting <code>mmap</code> for POSIX-style memory mappings, which Theseus has traditionally eschewed because they are unsafe and poorly-designed from a state management perspective<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.
In the future, we also may support POSIX-style signal handlers, but for now we have chosen to re-implement <code>wasmtime</code>'s signal handling directly in safe Rust atop Theseus rather than going through an unsafe <code>libc</code> FFI boundary for no good reason.</p>
<p>The bulk of the <code>mmap</code> implemenation for <code>tlibc</code> was added in <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/fffda853e71b5a0d7b20b850297962227e592850">commit fffda85</a>.
The key aspects of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tlibc</code> exposes a POSIX-style <code>mmap()</code> function that calls Theseus APIs to instantiate new <code>MappedPages</code> objects, and then saves them in a private list so that they aren't dropped until the corresponding <code>munmap()</code> call is invoked.
<ul>
<li>This is required because Theseus's abstraction of a virtual memory mapping, <code>MappedPages</code>, is auto-unmapped upon <code>drop</code> to guarantee safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, <code>mlock</code> and <code>munlock</code> are dummy functions because Theseus doesn't perform any swapping or paging to disk.</li>
<li>Memory protection (<code>mprotect</code>) is offered, but is currently limited because Theseus forces all current memory mappings to be marked as &quot;present&quot; in the page table.
<ul>
<li>Thus, stripping read permissions from a mapping technically works, but it violates the guarantees of the <code>MappedPages</code> type, i.e., the mapping is present and valid for the entire lifetime of a <code>MappedPages</code> object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While we were at it, we went even further with additional improvements to <code>theseus_cargo</code>, <code>libc</code>, and <code>tlibc</code> to <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/870fb246af68d02be7981374687b80c1429f48eb">facilitate integration of Rust and C code</a> atop Theseus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each time we implement a new feature in <code>tlibc</code>, we must also update
<a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/d0fbcd0e11d56183bb306d43430dc65d4d640869">Here's an example of that for <code>mmap</code></a>, with some testing functions included.</li>
<li><code>theseus_cargo</code> now supports building out-of-tree components <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/a685e062848d3b1522b2b962c21f51facb25726e">that depend on both Rust and C code</a>, e.g., native libraries.
<ul>
<li>It also now supports building <code>rlib</code> and <code>staticlib</code> crate types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We added <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/4b83e95cf128a0ecd67a6c5de39f18f8bb317048">basic <code>stdio</code> features to <code>tlibc</code></a>, e.g., for <code>printf</code>, which is useful for testing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, we fixed all the issues with <code>tlibc</code>, <code>libc</code>, and <code>theseus_cargo</code>.</p>
<p>Now, Rust and C code (both in-tree and out-of-tree components) can all be compiled and loaded/linked together in Theseus.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a href="#porting-region-to-theseus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="porting-region-to-theseus"></a>Porting <code>region</code> to Theseus</h4>
<p>With <code>tlibc</code> now supporting basic <code>libc</code> memory mapping functions, porting the <code>region</code> crate was fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>However, importantly, we chose to <em>not</em> force <code>region</code> on Theseus to depend on <code>tlibc</code>, mainly because it would introduce another layer of unsafety.
The <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/region-rs/commit/b4de9a22b5c3c8a1e2b9f2834fe33df27472891e#diff-761c91258f20f42f7145ee39c2cbac444849c5a5285f5d9695a3aeea4d27c6d5">primary implementation of <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code> are here</a>, which are similar to the <code>mmap()</code> implemenation in <code>tlibc</code>.
We also must express the <a href="https://docs.rs/region/3.0.0/region/struct.Protection.html"><code>region::Protection</code></a> type in terms of Theseus's page table <code>EntryFlags</code>, which was generally straightforward.</p>
<p>The one tricky part of <code>region</code> that we disliked is <a href="https://docs.rs/region/3.0.0/region/struct.QueryIter.html"><code>QueryIter</code></a>, which allows the caller to query <em>all</em> virtual memory areas across the entire current virtual address space to find ones that span or overlap with a certain range of addresses.<br />
This is problematic for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theseus's state management philosophy dictates that it does not maintain a centralized list of all memory mappings, so there's nothing to iterate over by default.</li>
<li>Theseus provides a very safe and clear API for interacting with memory mappings, which <a href="https://docs.rs/region/3.0.0/region/fn.query_range.html"><code>region::query_range()</code></a> completely ignores because it assumes a POSIX-style virtual memory API.</li>
<li>Theseus strives to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTTOU attacks</a> by avoiding the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_(computing)">handles that point to a resource indirectly</a>. By design (and by necessity atop conventional OSes), <code>QueryIter</code> separates the &quot;time of check&quot; from the &quot;time of use&quot;, leading to potentially confusing behavior and errors in which a memory region returned from a query no longer exists by the time one attempts to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, our solution was to allow <code>QueryIter</code> to expose and return <strong>only references to the memory areas already created by the <code>region</code> crate itself</strong>. This strives to mitigate safety issues that could arise by exposing <em>all</em> memory regions maintained by Theseus to higher-level Rust code that may use them unsafely through the <code>region</code> APIs.
Hopefully this feature restriction doesn't pose a problem in the future.</p>
<h3><a href="#supporting-thread-local-storage-on-theseus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="supporting-thread-local-storage-on-theseus"></a>Supporting Thread-Local Storage on Theseus</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">Thread-Local Storage (TLS)</a> allows one to declare a variable that will be instantiated on a per-thread basis, with each thread having its own local copy that other threads cannot access.
This is useful for many reasons, e.g., programming conveniencce, performant access to thread-specific data without locking, etc.
Our motivation for finally supporting it in its ultimate flexible form -- the ELF standard TLS areas -- stemmed from <code>wasmtime-runtime</code>, which uses it in myriad ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: previously, Theseus offered a cheap imitation of TLS using the GS register to store limited, targeted data about each task, but it wasn't usable by any applications, libraries, or even other non-<code>task</code> kernel crates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We implemented TLS support <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/3e6c50a0a45560057c6a35db4ce220760e362962">across several commits</a>.
This was a suprisingly complex and tricky implementation that required a lot of trial-and-error experimentation to determine how to correctly layout each TLS object in the per-task TLS area.</p>
<p>Another complicating factor is that Theseus loads and links all crates at runtime, which means that our implementation <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/fd1f11d99f1b4252abb35fffe7ae45f9f7ca616b">must support both statically-linked TLS areas from the base kernel image as well as newcomers found in dynamically-loaded crates</a>.
There are a lot of tradeoffs herein as it relates to reserving and allocating offset ranges in the TLS space for TLS data sections, tracking TLS data sections per namespace, per crate, etc -- but these are best saved for a separate post about TLS.</p>
<p>We went a step further by implementing <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/dd62aff423e1deceed503e3341827ba1e04dce79">Rust's <code>thread_local!()</code> macro</a> for any Theseus crate, which offers lazy dynamic initialization and cleanup of TLS areas.
This overcomes the limitations of standard ELF TLS sections, which behave like <code>static</code> globals in Rust: they are <code>const</code>-initialized and never dropped.</p>
<h3><a href="#porting-the-object-crate-to-theseus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="porting-the-object-crate-to-theseus"></a>Porting the <code>object</code> crate to Theseus</h3>
<p>The <code>object</code> crate is standalone and doesn't need to be ported to Theseus specifically, thus we can simply port it to <code>no_std</code> and place it in Theseus's <code>libs/</code> directory.
The only real difficulty here is that while <code>object</code> <em>does</em> support <code>no_std</code>,  no previous users of <code>object</code> needed to <em>write</em> to an object file in a <code>no_std</code> environment.
Thinking about it, we do agree that's kind of weird, but Theseus is just like that sometimes. 😊</p>
<p>Once we convinced the maintainers of <code>object</code> that this feature was necessary, the changes required to do so weren't very involved.
It boiled down to a rearrangement of <code>object</code>'s Cargo features and configuration blocks: check out the <a href="https://github.com/gimli-rs/object/pull/400">PR we submitted (that was accepted)</a> for more details.</p>
<h2><a href="#miscellaneous-improvements" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="miscellaneous-improvements"></a>Miscellaneous Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/05f1213a562639be74aa7ceaeef301a23e86e97a">improved the page allocator</a> to allow it to lazily merge contiguous freed chunks of pages.
<ul>
<li>This happens lazily after an allocation request first fails; it is possible to also do it proactively in <code>AllocatedPages::drop()</code>, but that makes deallocation more expensive.</li>
<li>Needed for loading C object files or static libraries with entry points at a fixed address, e.g., the default entry point of <code>0x400000</code>.</li>
<li>Future work: support building and loading position-independent executables (PIE, and PIC). This is required to simultaneously load multiple C executables at the same fixed address, because Theseus only offers a single virtual address space.</li>
